I’m all alone now, check it out
Me and you should take a vacay
I got a plan now, we’re going out
See you waiting for another day

Here’s the thing I wanna talk about
Listen all you got to hear me out
We get it done, we get it done my own way
I just wanna say

Hey now, hey now
I haven’t had a good laugh for a day now
Hey now, hey now
You know you’re down, let’s do this right now
Hey now, hey now
Up top, we’re the kings of the playground
Hey now, hey now
You know you’re down, let’s do this right now

Let’s.. right now
Wait!
Let’s do this right now

What’s the hol’ up
Take your clothes off
Dance again
In the pillows
Run the dedo
It don’t matter
We can play
Sing diamond nana
It’s the summer
Got exotic
Catch the rays
Hey, sun is never going down
All we have all day

Maybe you’re tanked completely
Really I dont mean to sound cheesy
It’s way too easy
You can wear it up in a beenie
Its so out now it looks sleezy, as wear

And this day’s amazing
Out here we can make it
Your pop, left the beemer
I think we should take it, yeah

Hey now, hey now
I haven’t had a good laugh for a day now
Hey now, hey now
You know you’re down, let’s do this right now
Hey now, hey now
Up top, we’re the kings of the playground
Hey now, hey now
You know you’re down, let’s do this right now

Let’s, right now
Wait!
We’re the kings of the playground
Hey now, hey now
Up top, we’re the kings of the playground
Hey now, hey now
You know, you down
Let’s do this right now.
