<h1>Johny Cash - Hurt</h1>
<pre>
I hurt myself today<br />
To see if I still feel<br />
I focus on the pain<br />
The only thing that's real<br />
The needle tears a hole<br />
The old familiar sting<br />
Try to kill it all away<br />
But I remember everything<br />
<br />
[Chorus:]<br />
What have I become<br />
My sweetest friend<br />
Everyone I know goes away<br />
In the end<br />
And you could have it all<br />
My empire of dirt<br />
I will let you down<br />
I will make you hurt<br />
<br />
I wear this crown of thorns<br />
Upon my liar's chair<br />
Full of broken thoughts<br />
I cannot repair<br />
Beneath the stains of time<br />
The feelings disappear<br />
You are someone else<br />
I am still right here<br />
<br />
[Chorus:]<br />
What have I become<br />
My sweetest friend<br />
Everyone I know goes away<br />
In the end<br />
And you could have it all<br />
My empire of dirt<br />
I will let you down<br />
I will make you hurt<br />
<br />
If I could start again<br />
A million miles away<br />
I would keep myself<br />
I would find a way<br /> 
</pre>
